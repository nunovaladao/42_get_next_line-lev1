# GET_NEXT_LINE ðŸ“–

This project is about programming a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.

  - This will be a **project** that will be added to the **library (libft)** and that may be useful in future projects.
  - I learned a highly interesting new concept in C programming: **static variables**.
